We propose a method for computing entropy over a set of graphs. Such a measurement would allow us to determine whether graphs exhibit homophily or heterophily. Knowing this is essential for ensuring that graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on a diverse range of graphs, thereby enhancing their robustness and generalizability. This research would be useful in the field of molecular dynamics, where measuring entropy over conformations in a molecular trajectory helps distinguish between minor thermal fluctuations and significant conformational changes. Beyond entropy computation, my approach offers a new characterization of geometric scattering, which is a transform that applies wavelet convolutions and non-linear activations to extract hierarchical, invariant features from data. Preliminary results show that the embeddings generated by the geometric scattering module are more expressive than those produced by traditional GNNs, which often suffer from over-smoothing. More expressiveness is valuable because it allows the model to capture richer, more nuanced information about graph structure, leading to better generalization and improved performance on tasks like classification or clusteringâ€”especially for complex or diverse datasets.
