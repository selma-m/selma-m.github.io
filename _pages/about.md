I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley. I am interested in AI alignment, and understanding how properties of learning systems emerge from training dynamics. In particular, I am currently working on relating complexity measures to neural network training behavior, with the goal of developing principled tools for reasoning about model generalization, robustness, and safety.

More broadly, I am interested in improving the safety and reliability of AI systems by deepening our theoretical and empirical understanding of why modern models behave the way they do. I am especially drawn to questions at the intersection of alignment, interpretability, and fairness, and I am curious about how insights from neuroscience might inform the study of artificial learning systems (and vice versa!).

I previously received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Yale University, where I had the chance to work with Professors <a href="https://wlab.yale.edu/profile/helen-caines">Helen Caines</a>, <a href="https://krishnaswamylab.org">Smita Krishnaswamy</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adelstein">Ian Adelstein</a>.  

I care deeply about mentorship and fostering inclusive research environments. I am always happy to chat with students and researchers, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. Please feel free to reach out!
