Hello! 
======
I am a senior at Yale majoring in applied mathematics with a concentration in machine learning. I am lucky to be advised by
<a href="https://krishnaswamylab.org">Smita Krishnaswamy</a>,
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adelstein">Ian Adelstein</a>, and
<a href="https://wlab.yale.edu/people/helen-caines">Helen Caines</a>. Currently, my
research interests lie in foundational machine learning, geometric learning,
physics-informed machine-learning models, and applications to sustainability.
